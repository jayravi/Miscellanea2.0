## hello,

Welcome to `Miscellanea.us`.

I am [Tanvi Jakkampudi](/page/about), geared up to start my freshman year at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu) as a Science & Humanities scholar.

This blog is where I share my thoughts, ideas, tips and stories--*bits & pieces*--of my life. I am a big fan of `LaTex`, `R-Lang` and `Python`. I am constantly learning to be better at coding and [speed cubing](https://www.google.com/logos/2014/rubiks/iframe/index.html).

I love *playing violin*, *reading* *&* *listening to music*. I also enjoy traveling and street photography. I like to see life with a positive mindset so I smile all the way. I love things-and-people who make me smile. 

#### thank you for stopping by!
