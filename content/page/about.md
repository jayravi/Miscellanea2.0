Hey everyone! I'm a member of the [Hockaday Class of 2018](https://hockadayfourcast.org/?s=class+of+2018) and incoming student in the Science & Humanities Scholars program--*Class of 2022*--at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.facebook.com/groups/cmuclassof2022/) . I'm interested in studying Biological Sciences, Neuroscience and Computational Biology and how these intersect with the healthcare industry. Originally from the suburbs of Dallas, I love trying new foods, photographing *&* exploring new places, and speed cubing in my free time.
